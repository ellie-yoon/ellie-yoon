## Hi thereðŸ‘‹ I'm Ellie(Jeewon) Yoon

With over six years of research experience in data analysis, I excel at meticulous data preprocessing and consistently pose logical questions to uncover the core causes of phenomena through root cause analysis. Before initiating an analysis, I prioritize thorough data exploration and research to deeply understand the underlying issues.

I have worked on various topics such as customer segmentation analysis, log data analysis, online experiment participant data analysis (research), and ADHD prediction modeling (research). Leveraging my experience with diverse tools, methodologies, and software, I am confident in my ability to quickly adapt to fast-changing work environments.
